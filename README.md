# New Era University Structure -Composite Design Pattern

This Java program models the organizational structure of New Era University using the **Composite Design Pattern**, strictly following **Object-Oriented Programming principles** .


## ðŸ§± Class Structure

- `UniversityComponent.java` â€“ Interface that defines all common operations  
- `Student.java` â€“ Leaf node representing a student  
- `Teacher.java` â€“ Leaf node representing a teacher  
- `Department.java` â€“ Composite node representing a department  
- `College.java` â€“ Composite node representing a college or sub-college  
- `Main.java` â€“ Client code that builds and demonstrates the university structure

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* `add()` and `remove()` operations are only supported by composite classes (`College`, `Department`).
* Leaf classes (`Student`, `Teacher`) throw `UnsupportedOperationException` on `add/remove`.
* Budget is calculated as:
  **Total Teacher Salaries âˆ’ Total Student Tuition Fees**
